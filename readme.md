## Java-Installer

As the name indicates, it is an automatic installer of Java (but only for Long Term Service versions [8, 11, 17, 21]).

It has a friendly user interface. I frequently use it to install a Java on public computers in our school.

### Usage

Basically if you are not a "baka", you can figure it out yourself.
