## Automatic Java (development pack) Installer

As the name indicates, it is an automatic installer of JDK (but only for Long Term Service versions [8, 11, 17, 21]).

It has a friendly user interface. I frequently use it to install JDK on public computers in our school.

### Usage

Basically, if you are not a "baka", you can figure it out yourself.

### Environmental Variables

To automatically add Environmental Variables on Windows, please run this script in Administrator Mode.
